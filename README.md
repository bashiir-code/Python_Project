üé¨ Movie Industry Correlation Analysis (1986‚Äì2016)
üìÅ Project Description
This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of 6,820 movies released between 1986 and 2016. The primary goal is to uncover correlations and patterns that help explain the factors contributing to a movie's commercial and critical success.

The dataset includes numerical and categorical features such as budget, gross revenue, IMDb ratings, user votes, genre, and key personnel (director, writer, and lead actor/actress).

Key Questions Addressed:
Does a higher budget correlate with higher revenue?

Is there a relationship between IMDb scores and box office performance?

Which features have the strongest correlations with movie success?

Do production companies or countries significantly influence outcomes?

Tools & Libraries Used:
Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation

Seaborn, Matplotlib for visualization

Jupyter Notebook for analysis and reporting
