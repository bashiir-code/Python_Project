\maketitle

\section*{üìÅ Project Description}

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of 6,820 movies released between 1986 and 2016. The primary goal is to uncover \textbf{correlations and patterns} that help explain the factors contributing to a movie's commercial and critical success.

The dataset includes numerical and categorical features such as budget, gross revenue, IMDb ratings, user votes, genre, and key personnel (director, writer, and lead actor/actress).

\vspace{1em}
The analysis addresses questions such as:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.5em]
    \item Does a higher budget correlate with higher revenue?
    \item Is there a relationship between IMDb scores and box office performance?
    \item Which features have the strongest correlations with movie success?
    \item Do production companies or countries significantly influence outcomes?
\end{itemize}

\vspace{1em}
The tools and libraries used include:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.5em]
    \item \texttt{Pandas}, \texttt{NumPy} for data manipulation
    \item \texttt{Seaborn}, \texttt{Matplotlib} for visualization
    \item \texttt{Jupyter Notebook} for analysis and reporting
\end{itemize}

\section*{üîç Objective}

By calculating correlation coefficients and visualizing relationships between variables, this project seeks to provide data-driven insights into what drives a movie's success and how different features interact.
